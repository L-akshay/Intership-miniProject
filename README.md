# ⏳ Countdown Timer Web App

A mini project built as part of my **Web Development Internship at CodeClause**. This app allows users to set a countdown to a specific date and time — ideal for events, launches, or personal reminders.

## 🚀 Features

- Live countdown timer
- Real-time updates (days, hours, minutes, seconds)
- Clean and responsive UI
- Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## 🎯 Project Aim

To build a functional and visually appealing countdown timer while learning real-time **date and time manipulation** using JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure
- **CSS3** – Styling and UI design
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Logic and timer control

## 📚 What I Learned

- Date object manipulation in JavaScript
- DOM manipulation and interval updates
- Creating responsive layouts and styling dynamic content
